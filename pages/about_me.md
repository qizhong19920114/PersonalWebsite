## Nice meeting you

I'm always fascinated by new challenges, especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies.

I find myself at the intersection between __creativity__ and __logic__, solving problems
with a fresh and multidisciplinary approach.

In the last __3 years__ _of my career_, I have developed in a multitude of programming languages starting from C to python, java and javascript.

I'm more than just a full-stack developer, I also do business analysis and internet marketing.

My hobbies include reading, improv and fitness.

I'm a full-time software developer, always looking for new challenges and inspiring projects.

## Skills

 - Full stack web development.
 - Mobile application development.
 - Business analytics.
 - Online marketing.

I'm currently developing in __Javascript__, __React__, __React Native__ and __NodeJS__
creating APIs, Backends, Front-ends, and mobile applications.

__MongoDB__, __Redis__, __GraphQL__ and a bunch of __Relational Databases__ are always in my mind and at the tip of my fingertips.

I have also a good knowledge of different __Python__ frameworks and tool kits such as __Django__, __Flask__, and __Scikit-learn__.I have no problem dealing with other languages such as  __Java__, __C/C++__ etc.

I think of a programming language is just a tool in one's toolbox.
You just have to pick the right tool for the job.

Always experimenting, always learning, always looking for challenges.
